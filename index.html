								<h1><strong>Are you immune to COVID-19?</strong></h1>
							</header>
							<p>Vaccination protects us from the attack of the coronavirus disease by stimulating our immune system to combat the virus. However, the vaccine efficacy may vary between individuals depending on factors like your age, gender, and the type of vaccine you received. One way to test whether your body has been successfully trained to protect you from the virus is by testing the antibody levels in your blood. The antibody test will tell you whether you are really immune to COVID-19, and even its variants.</p>

						<h2>About Our Research</h2>
						</div>
						<p><strong>The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the disease has been spread worldwide resulting in an unprecedented health crisis. To prevent COVID-19, there has been research on various types of vaccines including viral vector, protein subunit, inactivated virus, and nucleic acid-based vaccines since April 2020. There are two types of vaccines available in Hong Kong including the inactivated vaccine (Sinovac, China) and the mRNA vaccine (BioNTech, Germany). More data and research are needed to understand the impacts and individual effectiveness of the vaccines.</strong></p> 
						<p><strong>We are a research team at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology who aim to study the ability of COVID-19 vaccines to provoke immune responses. To address urgent global health concerns, we seek to answer questions including: </strong></p> 
						<li><strong><i>(1) Do age, gender, genetic factors and medical history affect the generation of antibody type and concentration of circulating antibody in the two vaccines? </i></strong></li>
						<li><strong><i>(2) How does the ratio and composition of different antibodies in the antiserum differ between the first and second vaccine doses and length between each dose? </i></strong></li>
						<li><strong><i>(3) What are the structures for the different classes of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and whether they are cross-immune to common human coronavirus and COVID-19 variants?</i></strong></li>

						<h2>What We Do</h2>
					</div>
					<h3>Study population</h3>
					<p><strong>We target any vaccinated or unvaccinated participants aged 18 or above in Hong Kong, regardless of their race, gender, or occupation. We will distribute a survey that obtains respondents’ particulars including age, gender, and COVID-19 vaccination history from March to July 2021. We anticipate a total of at least 250 participants to be enrolled in the serological tests with no less than 30 for each age cohort defined below: </strong></p>
					<li><strong><i>Elderly</i> refers to adults aged 65 or above.</strong></li>
					<li><strong><i>Middle-aged adults</i> refer to adults aged 30 to 64.</strong></li>
					<li><strong><i>Young adults</i> refer to adults aged between 18 to 29.</i></strong></li>
					<p></p>
					<h3>Patient and public involvement</h3>
					<p><strong>1.	Registered health care professions (e.g. doctors, nurse, technicians) will assist in blood sample collection from the participants who are willing to take the blood tests.</strong></p>
					<p><strong>2.	Professional clinics for blood collections at many places around Hong Kong island, Kowloon, and New Territories will be available for participants to choose their most convenient locations.</strong></p>
					<p><strong>3.	The blood collection procedures will be explained to each participant and an informed consent form will need to be signed by both the research assistant and the participant beforehand. The email-attached consent form will ensure our research process is transparent to the persons involved in our research and will obtain consent from the participants for personal data/information collection.</strong></p>
					<p><strong>At the end of the study (1.5 to 2 years). Participants should receive a blood test report for all blood samples taken throughout the study free of charge. The blood report will answer the following questions:</strong></p>
					<li><strong>(a)	Seropositivity: Is the anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody present in your blood?</li></strong>
					<li><strong>(b)	Antibody concentration: How much of this antibody is present in your blood?</li></strong>
					<li><strong>(c)	Immunogenic protection: Whether you are protected by the vaccine you received from COVID-19 and its variants</li></strong>
					<p></p>
					<h3>Blood sample collection</h3>
					<p><strong>A total of 3-4 serological tests will be given to each participant depending on whether they have received the first dose or not. For individuals vaccinated at least once, they should expect to take the blood test 28 days after injection of the first dose, 2-3 weeks after the second dose, and 6 months after their second dose. For unvaccinated individuals, they should expect to take the blood test in the same manner except there will be one extra test before their first vaccination. Notification will be sent via email to the participant a week before the serological test. Serological test one year after the second dose may be required depending on the participation rate and previous test results. </strong></p>
					<p><strong>Participants who agree to take a serological test will need to visit the university clinic for blood collection. Each collection will draw 10-27 mL of whole blood from their vein. All collected blood samples will be stored at 4-8ºC and tested within 24 hours in our research laboratory.</strong></p>
